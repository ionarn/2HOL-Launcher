### 2HOL Launcher
## Edit 2HOL settings with ease!
Hello there!
A few years ago I started to develop a Launcher for 2HOL with Python and Qt (PyQt5). I came quite far with it, but then discovered the game engine Godot.
I then tried to build the 2HOL Launcher with it and I liked how the Godot engine works a lot. Since then, I'm developing the Launcher with Godot.

The Launcher will be available for Windows an Linux with the same User Interface.

#### âš  The Launcher is not yet ready to use. Most Buttons already work as intended, but I still need to make sure the launcher will work even in edge cases. Until I consider the Launcher to somewhat stable, I won't publish a 2HOL Launcher executable or *.exe.

## With the 2HOL Launcher you will be able to ...
  * enter and use login credentials for playing 2HOL
  * change 2HOL game settings
  * open the most common 2HOL websites
  * change Hetuw and Day-Cycle mod settings
  * start the game
  * view change logs
